The purpose of this app is to help keep track of issues and service calls that Rocket Daddy performs for its clients.

App objectives:
    * Track client issues that are submitted for assistance (issues that can be resolved without performing a service visit)
    * Track client service calls performed by Rocket Daddy
    * Assign an issue ID to each tracked issue
    * Track the number of hours worked on each service call
    * Track issue and service call notes
    * Track issue and service call assigned technicians
    * Track dates for issues and service calls (date of issue, and date issue was resolved)
    * Add any invoicing information that needs to be handled with a service call (ie hours worked, any installation or equipment costs)
    * Track upcoming site walkthroughs


App building notes:
    - This app will use the following languages:
        * HTML/CSS
        * JavaScript
        * Node.js
        * MongoDB (for storing issues/calls)

    - This app will need to store the following:
        * Technicians (stored in API OR just an array stored locally since no other properties will be needed)
        * Clients (stored in API to track issues to clients)
        * Issue

    - Each issue will need the following properties:
        * ID -> Str (client abbreviation + client issue number [Ex: JWB-001])
        * Client -> Str (pulled from the client API/list)
        * Issue title -> Str
        * Issue description -> Str
        * Issue date -> Date (allow date selection)
        * Assigned technician -> Str (pulled from the technician API/list)
        * Issue/technician notes -> Str
        * Issue status -> Array["Pending", "In Progress", "Pending", "Canceled"] (should default to 'Pending' when issue is created)
        * Issue resolved date -> Timestamp (default to current time/date; should be able to be adjusted)
